# Google Maps Store LocatorðŸŒŽ

- A Javascript Project to build an App to locate stores at the Google Maps
- If the map is not showing... Apologies (the API key might have been disabled LOL)

## How it works?

When you click on markers or the list menu a popup window opens showing some details of that store. Also you can search the the store by its Zip Code.

## What you can do?

You can use it as your store locator or anything like farms or food points in your city.

### How?

- Fork this Repository
- Update Location Coordinates
- Update Data (Name, phone number)

That's it, Now it's your Locator.
